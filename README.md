Static and AI-powered analysis for AWS CDK - runs `cdk-insights scan` against your synthesized stacks and surfaces findings as PR comments, GitHub Code Scanning alerts, and downloadable reports.

> **Requires `cdk-insights` >= 1.44.1.** The CLI is installed automatically (`latest` by default), so no action is needed unless you pin an older version via `cdk-insights-version`. Explicit `ai-model` selection requires CLI 1.60.0+; complete static/CDK Nag finding-class gating requires 1.60.1+.

## Features

- **145 rules across 36 AWS services** - security misconfigurations, cost waste, reliability gaps, and Well-Architected Framework pillar violations
- **AI-powered recommendations** - every privacy-safe user resource is reviewed, including resources not flagged by static rules
- **Five selectable Bedrock models** - GLM 4.7 Flash is the rich, cost-effective default; opt into premium reasoning when a scan warrants it
- **Predictable monthly credits** - 500 Free, 10,000 Pro, or 20,000 per Team seat; unchanged cache hits cost 0 and there are no automatic overage charges
- **PR comments** - severity-bucketed summary posted on pull requests via `gh` CLI
- **GitHub Code Scanning** - SARIF generated and auto-uploaded to the Security tab
- **Report artifacts** - JSON, SARIF, and markdown reports persisted as downloadable workflow artifacts
- **Per-pillar fail gating** - fail the build on Security findings only (default), or opt into Reliability / Cost / etc.
- **Per-class fail gating** - block on `security` / `compliance` findings while best-practice advice stays advisory, independent of severity (`fail-on-class`)
- **Single-pass reports** - with `cdk-insights >= 1.44.1` the JSON, SARIF, and Markdown reports are produced from one scan (no duplicate analysis or scan-history upload)

## Quick Start

```yaml
name: CDK Insights
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write  # Required for PR comments

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '24'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: CDK Insights Analysis
        uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
        with:
          license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}
          ai-analysis: true
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `license-key` | CDK Insights license key. Required for AI analysis. Free, Pro, and Team license keys are all supported - quotas are enforced server-side. | No | - |
| `working-directory` | Directory containing the CDK project (validated to stay inside `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`). | No | `.` |
| `stack-name` | Specific stack to analyze. Omit to analyze every stack (`--all`). | No | (all stacks) |
| `ai-analysis` | Enable AI-powered recommendations. Requires `license-key`. Set to `false` with a license key to pass `--local` and force static-only analysis. | No | `false` |
| `ai-model` | Model alias: `glm-4-7-flash` (0.5 credits/resource), `nova-lite` (0.5), `mistral-14b` (1), `haiku-4-5` (4), or `sonnet-4-6` (16). Requires CLI 1.60.0+. Omit to use the CLI default, GLM 4.7 Flash. | No | CLI default |
| `fail-on` | Fail workflow on severity levels (comma-separated: `critical,high,medium,low`), or `never` for an advisory scan. Omit to fail on any finding within `fail-on-pillars` scope. Invalid values fail configuration validation. | No | - |
| `fail-on-pillars` | Which Well-Architected pillars count toward `fail-on`. Comma-separated list of `security`, `reliability`, `cost optimization`, `operational excellence`, `performance efficiency`, `sustainability`, or the shorthand `all`. Findings from other pillars are still reported but won't block the deploy. | No | `security` |
| `fail-on-class` | Fail the build on findings of these **classes**, regardless of severity or pillar. Comma-separated list of `security`, `best-practice`, `compliance`. Orthogonal to `fail-on` / `fail-on-pillars` - block on real risk while best-practice advice stays advisory. Use `cdk-insights >= 1.60.1` so static, CDK Nag, validation, and AI findings are all classified. | No | (off) |
| `pr-comment` | Post analysis summary as a PR comment (uses the `gh` CLI, authenticated via the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`). | No | `true` |
| `sarif-upload` | Generate SARIF and auto-upload to GitHub Code Scanning. Requires `security-events: write`. | No | `false` |
| `upload-artifact` | Upload JSON, SARIF, and markdown report files as a workflow artifact. | No | `true` |
| `artifact-name` | Name for the uploaded artifact. | No | `cdk-insights-report` |
| `github-token` | Token used for SARIF upload to Code Scanning. | No | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `services` | Filter analysis to specific AWS services (comma-separated, e.g. `S3,Lambda,IAM`). | No | (all services) |
| `rule-filter` | Filter to specific rules (comma-separated rule IDs). | No | - |
| `cdk-insights-version` | npm version of `cdk-insights` to install. Use `latest` or a semver string. Minimum supported: `1.44.1`. | No | `1.61.0` |
| `deployment-preview` | Compare the synthesized assembly with a committed, known-good template baseline. Requires CLI 1.61.0+. | No | `false` |
| `deployment-baseline` | Baseline created by `cdk-insights preview --write-baseline`. | No | `.cdk-insights-template-baseline.json` |
| `deployment-fail-on` | Block at `never`, `review`, or `block` deployment recommendation. | No | `block` |
| `policy-file` | Version-controlled infrastructure contract to enforce. Empty disables the policy guard. | No | - |
| `reliability-check` | Review AZ, dependency, quota-pressure and regional-recovery weaknesses. | No | `false` |
| `live-check` | Compare with deployed CloudFormation templates and existing drift results using the workflow AWS identity. | No | `false` |
| `live-fail-on` | Live-state failure policy: `never`, `drift`, or `risk`. | No | `never` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `total-issues` | Total number of issues found across every pillar |
| `critical-count` | Number of critical issues (full totals - not pillar-filtered) |
| `high-count` | Number of high severity issues |
| `medium-count` | Number of medium severity issues |
| `low-count` | Number of low severity issues |
| `sarif-file` | Comma-separated paths to generated SARIF file(s) |
| `json-file` | Comma-separated paths to JSON results file(s) |
| `artifact-id` | ID of the uploaded artifact (omitted if `upload-artifact: false`) |
| `exit-code` | `1` if any in-scope finding exists when `fail-on` is omitted, any finding matches a configured `fail-on` severity, or any finding matches `fail-on-class`; otherwise `0` |

> Severity outputs always reflect **full totals** so PR comments and downstream badges never hide findings. The fail-on gate uses pillar-filtered counts internally.

## Examples

### Static Analysis (No License)

145 rules with PR comments - no signup required:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
```

### AI-Powered Analysis

Enable Bedrock-backed recommendations. The CLI shows the selected model, its per-resource credit rate, and the maximum scan cost before analysis begins. Free accounts receive 500 credits/month, Pro receives 10,000, and Team receives 20,000 per seat:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}
    ai-analysis: true
```

The default GLM 4.7 Flash model costs 0.5 credits per fresh resource and is available on every tier. To spend more credits on premium reasoning for a particular workflow:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}
    ai-analysis: true
    ai-model: haiku-4-5 # 4 credits per fresh resource
```

AI scans every privacy-safe user resource rather than only resources with an existing static finding. Repeat scans of unchanged resources use cached results and cost 0 credits.

### Deployment intelligence guardrails

Create and review a template baseline on your main branch, then commit it:

```bash
npx cdk-insights preview --write-baseline
git add .cdk-insights-template-baseline.json
```

The action synthesizes once, runs the normal security scan, and reuses the same `cdk.out` for each enabled guard:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    cdk-insights-version: '1.61.0'
    deployment-preview: true
    deployment-fail-on: review
    policy-file: .cdk-insights-policy.json
    reliability-check: true
```

For a live-state comparison, configure AWS credentials earlier in the job and grant only `cloudformation:GetTemplate`, `cloudformation:DescribeStacks`, and `cloudformation:DescribeStackResourceDrifts`:

```yaml
    live-check: true
    live-fail-on: drift
```

The action never starts drift detection and never mutates AWS resources.

### Static-Only with License Key

Force static analysis even when a license key is present (passes `--local` to the CLI, preserving your AI credits):

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}
    ai-analysis: false
```

### Start with an advisory scan

Use `fail-on: never` while reviewing findings and agreeing on justified exceptions:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    fail-on: never
    pr-comment: true
    upload-artifact: true
```

All findings, severity counts, PR comments and requested reports remain available;
the scan's `exit-code` output is `0`. Installation, synthesis and CLI errors still
fail the step, as do separately enabled deployment, policy, reliability and live
checks. Do not use `continue-on-error` to hide those failures.

`never` must be used alone and cannot be combined with `fail-on-class`. Omitting
`fail-on` is **not** advisory: it blocks on every severity in the selected pillars.

For an intentional exception, add a reason to `.cdk-insights.json`:

```json
{
  "ignoreRules": [
    { "id": "ecs-service-connect-access-logs-missing", "reason": "Development-only service; production keeps access logs enabled" }
  ]
}
```

This suppresses the rule across the project. For a narrower exception with the
CDK Insights synth plugin, use CDK 2.271.0 or later and
`Validations.of(resource).acknowledge({ id: 'cdk-insights::ecs-service-connect-access-logs-missing', reason: '...' })`
on the intended construct. Recheck the report with an unsuppressed example before
enabling enforcement. When ready, replace `never` with `critical,high` and select
the pillars your team wants to gate.

### Fail on Critical/High Security Issues

By default the action only fails on **Security** pillar findings. To block merges on critical or high severity security issues:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}
    ai-analysis: true
    fail-on: critical,high
```

### Gate on Multiple Well-Architected Pillars

Include Reliability and Cost findings in the fail-on gate (otherwise they're reported but non-blocking):

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}
    fail-on: critical,high
    fail-on-pillars: security,reliability,cost optimization
```

Or fail on any pillar:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    fail-on: critical
    fail-on-pillars: all
```

### Specific Stack

Analyze only a specific CDK stack:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    stack-name: ProductionStack
```

### GitHub Code Scanning (SARIF)

When `sarif-upload: true`, the action automatically generates SARIF files and uploads them to GitHub's Security tab - no extra steps needed:

```yaml
jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      security-events: write  # Required for SARIF upload

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '24'
      - run: npm ci

      - uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
        with:
          license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}
          sarif-upload: true
          fail-on: critical,high
```

> **Note:** SARIF upload to the Security tab requires Code Scanning to be enabled on the repository. This is free for public repos. Private repos require GitHub Advanced Security.

### Report Artifacts

By default (`upload-artifact: true`), all report files are uploaded as a downloadable GitHub artifact. This includes JSON, SARIF, and markdown reports. You can find them in the workflow run summary under "Artifacts".

To customize the artifact name:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    artifact-name: security-report
```

To disable artifact upload:

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    upload-artifact: false
```

### Full Example

A complete workflow with all features enabled:

```yaml
name: CDK Insights Analysis
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'lib/**'
      - 'bin/**'
      - 'cdk.json'

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      security-events: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '24'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: CDK Insights Analysis
        id: analysis
        uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
        with:
          license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}
          ai-analysis: true
          fail-on: critical,high
          fail-on-pillars: security
          pr-comment: true
          sarif-upload: true
          upload-artifact: true
          artifact-name: cdk-insights-report
```

This will:
1. Analyze all CDK stacks with AI-powered recommendations
2. Post a severity-bucketed summary as a PR comment
3. Upload SARIF results to the GitHub Security tab
4. Persist JSON, SARIF, and markdown reports as downloadable artifacts
5. Fail the workflow if any **Security** finding is critical or high (other pillars are reported but non-blocking)

### Monorepo with Multiple CDK Projects

```yaml
jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        project: [backend, frontend-api, data-pipeline]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
        with:
          working-directory: packages/${{ matrix.project }}
          artifact-name: cdk-insights-${{ matrix.project }}
          license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}
```

### Using Outputs in Subsequent Steps

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  id: analysis
  with:
    license-key: ${{ secrets.CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY }}

- name: Check results
  run: |
    echo "Total issues: ${{ steps.analysis.outputs.total-issues }}"
    echo "Critical: ${{ steps.analysis.outputs.critical-count }}"
    echo "Artifact ID: ${{ steps.analysis.outputs.artifact-id }}"

    if [ "${{ steps.analysis.outputs.critical-count }}" -gt "0" ]; then
      echo "::warning::Critical issues found!"
    fi
```

### Filter by AWS Services

```yaml
- uses: instancelabs/cdk-insights-action@v1
  with:
    services: S3,Lambda,DynamoDB,IAM
```

## Permissions

The action requires different permissions depending on features used:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # Always required
  pull-requests: write    # Required for PR comments
  security-events: write  # Required for SARIF upload to Code Scanning
```

| Permission | Required For | When to Add |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `contents: read` | Checking out code | Always |
| `pull-requests: write` | PR comments | When `pr-comment: true` (default) |
| `security-events: write` | SARIF upload to Security tab | When `sarif-upload: true` |

> **Note:** Artifact upload uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions and does not require additional permissions.

## Environment Variables

The full workflow environment is forwarded to the `cdk-insights` CLI subprocess, so anything a `cdk synth` needs at runtime - AWS credentials, region, project config - works out of the box:

- `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (for SDK lookups during synth)
- `CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT`, `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION` (for environment-targeted stacks)
- Any project-specific vars your CDK app reads (e.g. `STAGE`, dotenv-loaded config)

The action sets `CI=true` and `CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY` (when `license-key` is provided) on top of the inherited env. License keys are masked via `core.setSecret()` so they never appear in logs.

If your CDK app needs AWS credentials at synth time, configure them with [`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) before this action - ideally via OIDC, not long-lived keys.

## PR Comment Example

When `pr-comment: true` (default), the action posts a summary like:

> ## CDK Insights Analysis
>
> **Stack:** MyStack | **Resources:** 47 | **Issues:** 19 | **Analysis:** AI-powered
>
> ### Summary by Severity
>
> | Severity | Count |
> |----------|-------|
> | Critical | 2 |
> | High | 5 |
> | Medium | 12 |
>
> ### Top Issues
>
> 1. **S3 bucket without encryption** (Critical)
>    `MyStack/DataBucket` - Enable server-side encryption
>
> 2. **Lambda without DLQ** (High)
>    `MyStack/ProcessorFunction` - Add dead-letter queue
>
> <details>
> <summary>View all 19 issues</summary>
> ...
> </details>
