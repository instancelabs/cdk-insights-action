# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- Explicit `fail-on: never` advisory scans retain findings and reports without failing on findings. CLI failures and separately enabled guardrails still fail.
- Guidance for starting advisory, reviewing justified exceptions and enabling enforcement.

### Fixed

- Invalid severity values now fail configuration validation instead of silently disabling enforcement.
- Ambiguous combinations of `never` with severity or class gates are rejected.

## [1.6.5] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- Updated generated CLI arguments to use the canonical kebab-case option names while remaining compatible with supported CLI versions.
- Added a contract test that rejects camelCase flags from future Action-generated command lines.
- Rebuilt the committed Action bundle with the canonical arguments.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-08-11

### Security

- Hardened command execution and environment handling at the CI trust boundary.
- Redacted sensitive subprocess output and validated user-controlled inputs.
- Refreshed audited dependencies and rebuilt the committed Action bundle.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Added optional deployment preview, policy, reliability, and live-state guardrails.

### Changed

- Updated the bundled default CLI to 1.61.0 for infrastructure intelligence commands.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Machine-readable CLI JSON is now captured silently instead of being streamed by the process runner and repeated as a debug command, preventing full reports from flooding GitHub Action logs.
- The `fail-on-class` action metadata now states that CLI 1.60.1+ is required for complete classification coverage.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- The Action conclusion now uses the same gate calculation as its `exit-code` output. With no `fail-on` input, any finding within `fail-on-pillars` fails the workflow as documented.
- CLI JSON is kept out of normal Action logs, and expected machine-format diagnostics are logged as information instead of warnings.
- Direct SARIF uploads now include `checkout_uri` so GitHub can resolve relative artifact locations reliably.

### Changed

- Documented that CLI 1.60.1+ is required for complete finding-class coverage across static, CDK Nag, validation, and AI findings.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- `ai-model` input for choosing GLM 4.7 Flash, Nova Lite, Mistral 14B, Claude Haiku 4.5, or Claude Sonnet 4.6. Aliases are validated before invoking the CLI and the chosen model is forwarded to both the primary scan and legacy SARIF fallback.

### Changed

- Updated AI documentation for the GLM 4.7 Flash default, per-model credit rates, full-resource AI coverage, zero-credit cache hits, and the new monthly allowances: 500 Free, 10,000 Pro, and 20,000 per Team seat.
- Clarified that allowances are fixed and server-enforced; there are no automatic usage overage charges.
- Removed a stale claim that the current installer uses `@actions/tool-cache`.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

Two pre-existing bugs surfaced by end-to-end testing against a real multi-stack CDK app. The action now documents a minimum supported CLI of **cdk-insights >= 1.44.1** (single-pass reports, `fail-on-class`, and `stack-name` scoping all depend on it; the action degrades gracefully on older CLIs).

- **Tool-cache hits couldn't find the CLI.** On a warm `@actions/tool-cache` (subsequent runs on self-hosted runners, or any runner with a populated tool cache), the cache-hit branch added `<cached>/bin` to `PATH`, but the binary lives at `<cached>/node_modules/.bin` (where the install branch correctly points). Cached runs failed with "Unable to locate executable file: cdk-insights". GitHub-hosted runners start with a cold cache each job, which is why it went unnoticed. The cached path is now correct and the binary's presence is verified before use (reinstalls if the cache is incomplete).
- **Specifying `stack-name` silently disabled every flag.** The `--` separator and stack name were emitted *before* the flags, so `--format`, `--reports`, `--warn-sensitive`, `--no-failOnCritical`, and `--prComment` all landed after `--` and were parsed as positional arguments rather than options - meaning no SARIF/markdown, no sensitive-data warning behaviour, etc. Stack selection is now emitted last, after all flags.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- `fail-on-class` input - fail the build on findings of a given **finding class** (`security`, `best-practice`, `compliance`), independent of severity and pillar. This complements `fail-on` / `fail-on-pillars`: a team can block on real risk (security / compliance) while best-practice advice stays advisory, even at the same severity. Gated action-side from the `findingClass` field the CLI emits (cdk-insights >= 1.43.0); older CLIs emit no class data, so the gate is a safe no-op. The `exit-code` output also reflects the class gate.

### Changed

- **Single-pass report generation (cdk-insights >= 1.44.0).** When SARIF and/or artifact reports are requested, the action now runs `cdk-insights scan` **once** with `--reports`, which writes the JSON, SARIF, and Markdown report files in a single analysis pass. Previously the action ran the CLI a second time purely to produce SARIF - re-synthesizing, re-running rules/AI, and (for licensed users) uploading a duplicate scan to scan history on every run. The action falls back to the previous two-run behaviour automatically on CLI versions older than 1.44.0.
- **Markdown report is now actually produced.** Because the single pass emits Markdown alongside JSON and SARIF, the `{stack}_analysis_report.md` files are now included in the uploaded artifact as documented. (Under the old json-only / sarif-only runs the CLI never wrote a Markdown report, so the artifact silently contained none.)

### Fixed

- **Duplicate SARIF uploads in multi-stack mode.** In `--all` mode the CLI writes a per-stack `{stack}_analysis_report.sarif` for every stack *and* a `consolidated_analysis_report.sarif` containing the union. The action uploaded all of them to GitHub Code Scanning, double-reporting every finding. It now uploads only the consolidated file when present (falling back to the per-stack file for single-stack runs). The same de-duplication applies to the report artifact.
- The legacy SARIF fallback run now mirrors the primary run's `--local` decision, so a license-holder who set `ai-analysis: false` no longer triggers AI analysis (and AI-credit spend) during SARIF generation.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- `fail-on-pillars` input to scope the fail-on gate by AWS Well-Architected pillar. Defaults to `security`, so Reliability, Cost, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, and Sustainability findings are surfaced in the report but no longer block the deploy. Accepts a comma-separated list of pillar names, or the shorthand `all`. Matches how other scanners (Snyk, SonarQube, Trivy) separate "found something" from "fail the build". No workflow change is required for existing consumers - the default behaviour is the correct default for most projects.

### Changed

- `AnalysisResults` now carries both `totalCounts` (for display and outputs) and `gatingCounts` (for exit-code gating). The `critical-count`/`high-count`/`medium-count`/`low-count` outputs still reflect full totals so PR comments and badges never hide findings, while the exit code honours `fail-on-pillars`.
- Per-stack reports are now always walked via `recommendations[].issues[]` rather than the summary block, so the pillar filter is applied accurately. Summary-only reports from older CLI versions fall back to unfiltered gating to avoid under-reporting.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- Forward the full workflow environment to the `cdk-insights` CLI subprocess. The previous `ENV_ALLOWLIST` (PATH, HOME, GITHUB_*, etc.) stripped every variable a non-trivial CDK app reads at synth time - AWS credentials (`AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`), CDK targeting (`CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT`, `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION`), and project-specific config (e.g. `STAGE`, `STRIPE_EVENT_SOURCE_NAME`, `TARGET_EVENT_BUS_NAME`). Users saw Zod / dotenv / `ParameterNotFound` errors during `cdk synth` because the CLI subprocess couldn't see the env vars their workflow had set. The CLI now inherits the workflow environment; secrets never leave the runner and the sensitive-data scanner redacts template contents before transmission. `CI=true` and `CDK_INSIGHTS_LICENSE_KEY` are still set explicitly.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-11

### Security

- Restricted subprocess environment to an allowlist of 15 variables instead of forwarding the entire `process.env`
- Added input validation for `stack-name`, `services`, `rule-filter`, and `cdk-insights-version` to prevent argument injection
- Added path traversal protection for `working-directory` (must resolve within `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`)
- Added `--` separator before positional stack name arguments to prevent flag injection
- Fixed CI workflow expression injection - step outputs now use `env:` block instead of inline `${{ }}`
- Fixed release workflow script injection - version variable is quoted and validated against semver pattern
- Added `permissions: contents: read` to CI workflow for least-privilege
- Pinned npm registry (`--registry https://registry.npmjs.org`) for `npm view` and `npm install`
- Removed unused `@actions/github` dependency (eliminates vulnerable `undici` transitive dependency)

### Added

- 11 new input validation tests (52 total tests)
- Empty string filtering for comma-separated `services` and `rule-filter` inputs

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- Tool caching for cdk-insights CLI - subsequent runs skip npm install entirely
- CLI crash detection - distinguishes between analysis findings and CLI failures
- Unit tests for inputs, outputs, and arg building (41 tests via vitest)
- `ai-analysis: false` now passes `--local` to force static-only analysis with a license key
- CI checks that `dist/` is up to date and validates action outputs
- `--all --yes` flags for CI-safe multi-stack analysis when no stack name is provided

### Fixed

- Removed `--ai` flag which does not exist in the cdk-insights CLI
- Removed `--outputFile` flag which does not exist in the CLI; action now discovers auto-generated report files
- Removed broken SARIF upload via `npx @github/codeql-action`; SARIF files are now generated for users to upload via `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`
- Fixed conflicting `--output` CLI flags when additional output format was requested
- Fixed `--services` and `--ruleFilter` arg passing to use yargs array format
- Fixed `exit-code` output to respect `fail-on` severity configuration
- Fixed `process.env` type safety (removed unsafe type assertion)
- Fixed org references from `cdkinsights` to `TheLeePriest` in release workflow and README
- Added `core.setSecret()` to mask license key in logs
- Disabled CLI's built-in `--failOnCritical` so the action controls failure thresholds consistently
- Passed `GITHUB_TOKEN` through environment for `gh` CLI PR comment authentication

### Changed

- Uses `--format` (preferred alias) instead of `--output` for CLI format flag
- Upgraded `softprops/action-gh-release` from v1 to v2 in release workflow
- Updated `sarif-upload` input description to reflect generation-only behavior
- Removed unused `output-format` and `output-file` inputs
- Replaced `@actions/io` with `@actions/tool-cache` for installation
- README fully updated to match current inputs, outputs, and usage patterns
